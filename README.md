# care_scribie_fe

> AI-powered clinical documentation (Scribe) plugin for the [CARE](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe) EMR.

`care_scribie_fe` is a **Care Frontend plugin** that brings AI **Scribe** capabilities to OHCN's EMR. A clinician records a consultation, the audio is transcribed and structured by a scribe backend implementing the open **MedScribe Alliance protocol** (e.g. [care_scribe_be](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_scribe_be)), and the extracted values are automatically matched and filled into CARE questionnaire forms — saving manual data entry and letting clinicians focus on the patient.

It runs as a **Vite Module Federation remote** loaded by [`care_fe`](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe) and adds a floating microphone control that records, transcribes, and auto-fills forms.

---

## ✨ What it does

- 🎙️ **Record consultations** — a floating mic button captures the doctor–patient conversation.
- 📝 **Live transcription** — audio is streamed to the scribe backend via the [`med-scribe-alliance-ts-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/med-scribe-alliance-ts-sdk) and returned as a transcript.
- 🧠 **Structured extraction** — a dynamic AI template (built from the current form's fields) instructs the model to return structured JSON (vitals, notes, etc.).
- ⚡ **Auto-fill forms** — extracted values are fuzzy-matched to CARE questionnaire fields and written into the form, then highlighted and scrolled into view for clinician review.
- 🔌 **Zero-route plugin** — integrates purely as a `Scribe` extension point on questionnaire/encounter forms; it defines no standalone pages.

## 🏗️ How it works (in brief)

```text
care_fe (host)  ──loads remoteEntry.js──▶  manifest.ts  ──extends "Scribe"──▶  ScribeController
                                                                                     │
                                          useScribe + template-builder ◀─────────────┘
                                                     │
                                   med-scribe-alliance-ts-sdk ──▶ Scribe backend (care_scribe_be)
```

1. `care_fe` loads this plugin as a federated remote and renders `ScribeController` on questionnaire forms.
2. The user records a consultation; audio is sent to the **scribe backend** through the **MedScribe Alliance SDK**.
3. A **dynamic template** built from the current form's fields tells the AI what JSON to return.
4. Extracted values are **fuzzy-matched** to question labels and written into CARE form responses.
5. Filled fields are **highlighted and scrolled into view** for review.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22.9.0**
- A running **[care_fe](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe)** instance configured to load this plugin
- A **scribe backend** — either the [care_scribe_be](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_scribe_be) CARE plugin (auto-detected via `window.CARE_API_URL`) or a standalone server set via `REACT_SCRIBE_BE_URL`

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Configure environment (optional — backend is auto-detected inside CARE)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server (build:watch + preview on port 10122)
npm start
```

`npm start` runs two processes concurrently:

| Script        | What it does                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build:watch` | Nodemon watches `src/` and runs `vite build` on changes |
| `preview`     | Serves built assets on **port 10122** with CORS enabled |

> ⚠️ Vite bakes `REACT_*` variables in at **build time** — rebuild after editing `.env`.

## 🔗 care_fe registration

Register the plugin in care_fe via admin pannel:

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:10122/assets/remoteEntry.js",
  "name": "care_scribie_fe"
}
```

care_fe resolves the package, loads `remoteEntry.js`, and mounts `ScribeController` on forms that expose the `Scribe` extension point.
